Under the Boardwalk
The Drifters
 
intro       G
 
                 G                                         D
verse1   Oh the sun beats down and melts the tar upon the roof
                   D                                                   G    G7
         And your shoes get so hot you wish your tired feet were fire-proof
                    C                     G
         Under the boardwalk, down by the sea
               G                   D               G
         On a blanket with my baby   is where I'll be
 
verse2   From a park nearby happy sounds from a carousel
         You can almost taste the hotdogs and french fries they sell
         Under the boardwalk, down by the sea
         On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be
 
                    Em
bridge   Under the boardwalk, out of the sun
                    D
         Under the boardwalk, we'll be having some fun
                    Em
         Under the boardwalk, people walking above
                    D
         Under the boardwalk, we'll be falling love
                    Em   Em    Em   Em
         Under the board-walk, board-walk
