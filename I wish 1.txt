E  A   A6     A7            D9  Dm6     A   E7
I wish I knew how it would feel to be free;

   A   A6      F#m            B7            E   E7
I wish I could break all the chains holding me.

   A   A6      A7            D9       Dm6        A   E7
I wish I could say all the things that I should say

         A    C#7      F#m  Bm       D9          Dm6      A
Say 'em loud, say 'em clear for the whole round world to hear.


E  A   A6       A7            D9         Dm6     A   E7
I wish I could share all the love that's in my heart,

    A   A6     F#m        B7            E   E7
Remove all the bars that keep us apart.

   A   A6         A7           D9   Dm6   A   E7
I wish you could know what it means to be me

            A  C#7   F#m      Bm     D9  Dm6       A
Then you'd see and agree that every man should be free.


E  A   A6       A7          D9     Dm6     A   E7
I wish I could give all I'm long - ing to give;

   A   A6      F#m           B7           E   E7
I wish I could live like I'm longing to live.

   A       A6          A7        D9       Dm6     A   E7
I wish that I could do all the things that I can do

            A  C#7       F#m  Bm      D9     Dm6  A
Though I'm way o - ver - due, I'd be start - ing anew.


E       A   A6      A7         D9  Dm6     A   E7
Well I wish I could be like a bird in the sky;

     A    A6      F#m        B7           E   E7
How sweet it would be if I found I could fly!

         A   A6      A7           D9  Dm6     A   E7
Oh, I'd soar to the sun and look down at the sea

          A     C#7       D9   Cdim
Then I'd sing 'cause I'd know, yeah,

          A     C#7       D9   Cdim
Then I'd sing 'cause I'd know, yeah

          A      C#7       D9      Cdim          A    C#7   D9
Then I'd sing 'cause I'd know, I'd know how it feels, 

    Cdim         A    C#7    D9
I'd know how it feels to be free,

     B7          A    E  D9   A
I'd know how it feels to be free.
