[Verse 1]

Em                D         G           D/F#  E5
     What a wonderful hesitation
Em                D          C  D/F#  E5
     who would bear to feel sorry for me
Em                   D                 G         F#   E
     dropped another pill just to calm me
Em                    D             Cmaj7            C   Cmaj7
     collapsed to my knees and fell fast into sleep

[Chorus]
                 C(9)
     There I was drifting
      G  Am      C       G
     way out into the sunshine
                  Am7            C           G
     expecting to crash but I'm tied to a string
             Am7       C       G
     Look at me I'm a tangled puppet
                   Am         C               G    D/F#     E
     I might be a mess but I sure can survive
Em                 D                 G        D/F#    E5
     find myself awake counting sad days
Em       D             C D/F#  E5
     1-2-3 that's too many for me
Em                   D                 G     F#   E
     dropped another pill just to find me
Em                   D
     reached for my hand
                  Cmaj7        C   Cmaj7
     but it was already there
                     C(9)
     then I started believin'
     G     Am                 C        G
     that I fell out of a tiny raindrop
                      Am7           C          G
     that  lost it's way when it decided  to roam
             Am7        C     G
     chasing me was a hungry dweller
                  Am             C            G
     but I had escaped it by pretending to die
      C   Cmaj7   C
     Come follow me you won't expect the illusion
                                G        D/F#   E
     you'll see, it's my immagination
      C   Cmaj7        C
     hand me your eyes
     C
     I will put them in front of mine
                          G
     You'll see a little better
     You'll see a little better

Verse X

Em                 D        G          D/F#   E5
     What a wonderful destination
Em              D        C    D/F# E5
     where I'm now I can no longer see
Em                   D             G         F#   E
     dropped another pill just to kill me
Em                    D              Cmaj7          C    Cmaj7
     collapsed to my knees and fell fast into sleep
