Black Velvet - Allanah Myles

Notes: The recording is tuned a half-step flat (Eb Ab Db Gb Bb Eb)
             but I am writing this as if in standard tuning.  
             It doesn't sound good in standard tuning to me though.
              Please correct the chords if you hear more precise alternates.

Intro: [whispering unintelligible phrase "..?  you enjoy yourself all day..?"]

E  (with blues fills) 
          Mmmmm     mmmm    oooooo  (ad lib)

E (down strum)               
Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
                                                    
Jamie Rogers on electro up high

Mamas dancing - baby on her shoulder

The sun is setting like molasses in the sky
    B (alpeg)                              A(alpeg)
The boy could sing and knew how to move  -  everything
G                      D
Always wanting more    -   it leaves you longing for


                A                     D
Chorus:         Black Velvet in that little boy's smile
                A                       G            Bm       (or D/F# maybe?)
                Black Velvet with that slow southern style
                A                      D                        
                A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
                 C7       B7    (no chord)       E
                Black Velvet   -   if you please


Up in Memphis the music is like a heat wave
White Lightnin'  -  bound to drive you wild
Mamas baby is in the heart of every school girl
Love me Tender leaves em cryin' in the isles

The way he moved it was a sin - so sweet and true
Always wanting more it leaves you longing for

-CHORUS-

A                   B                         E
Every word of every song that he sang is for you
A                  G          C7         B7  (no chord)              E
In a flash he was gone  -  it happened so soon    -    what could you do?

-solo-

-CHORUS-   2x

fade out on E with blues fills   (  vocals repeat "if you please")

COMPLETE LYRICS

Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancin' with baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky
The boy could sing, knew how to move, everything
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for


Chorus:
Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please


Up in Memphis the music's like a heatwave
White lightening, bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby's in the heart of every school girl
"Love me tender" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle
The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for


Chorus


Every word of every song that he sang was for you
In a flash he was gone, it happened so soon, what could you do?


(Solo)

chorus repeats 2x

If you please, if you please, if you please



This Version can also be played unbarred, but then it sounds horrible, so try out
the bar chords before you discard them. The advantage of the bar chords is you can
use an awesome dead beat strum with them that you can't with the normal chords,
I'll leave both here.
