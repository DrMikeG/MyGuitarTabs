Here are the words and chords for 'Love is all around' by the Troggs and
recently covered by Wet-Wet-Wet from the movie '4 Weddings and a Funeral'


Love Is All Around (Reg Presley) Dick James Music

    D           Em       G         A     D     Em   G   A
I feel it in my fingers, I feel it in my toes 
      D            Em            G      A       D   Em   G   A
Well, love is all around me, and so the feeling grows 
     D              Em     G        A       D   Em   G   A
It's written on the wind, it's everywhere I go 
   D             Em       G           A      D   Em   G   A
So if you really love me, come on and let it show 

Chorus

     G                Em
You know I love you, I always will 
    G                D
My mind's made up by the way that I feel 
    G              Em
There's no beginning, there'll be no end 
  G                 A
Cos on my love you can depend   

I see your face before me as I lay on my bed 
I kinda get to thinking of all the things you said 
You gave your promise to me and I gave mine to you 
I need someone beside me in everything I do 

You know I love you, I always will 
My mind's made up by the way that I feel 
There's no beginning, there'll be no end 
Cos on my love you can depend   

It's written on the wind, it's everywhere I go 
So if you really love me, come on and let it show   
Come on let it show
Come on let it show
Come on let it show
Come on let it show
Come on let it show
Come on let it show
Come on let it show
Come on let it show
