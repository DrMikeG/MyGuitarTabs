Verse 1:
E                       D
Please allow me to introduce myself
      A                 E
I'm a man of wealth and taste
E                      D
I've been around for a long long year
      A                     E
Stole many a man's soul and faith
E            D
I was around Jesus Christ
        A                  E
Had his moment of doubt and pain
E                   D
Made damn sure that Pilate
           A                    E
Washed his hands and sealed his fate


Chorus:
B                                           E
   Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name
           B                                E
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game


Verse 2:
Stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers.
Anastaria screamed in vain
I rode a tank held a gen'rals rank
When the blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank


(Chorus)


Verse 3:
I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the Gods they made
I shouted out "Who killed the Kennedy's?"
When after all it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I lay traps for troubadors
Who get killed before they reach Bombay


(Chorus)


Verse 4:
Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste


(Chorus)

     Hey is this the right chord placement for this song.  I am just
going off from what I heard on the radio the other day.  I don't have
a recording of the song.
Please make corrections if there are any.  
Thanks guys.....
