[D]They're talkin' about [Dsus4]a revolu[G]tion
It[Cadd9]sounds [D]like [Dsus4]a whisper

[G]    [C(add9)] [Em] [D]
While they're standing in the welfare lines
Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation
Wasting time in the enemployment lines
Sitting around waiting for a promotion

Poor people gonna rise up And get their share
[G]    [C(add9)] [Em] [D] x2
Poor people gonna rise up And take what's theirs

You better run, run, run...
Oh I said you better
Run, run, run...
Finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' bout a revolution 
Finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' bout a revolution
