Intro: C  G   F    C  G  F 
G 
Don't wish it away 
      Em                F     (C       F C F C F) 
Don't look at it like it's forever 
C               G 
Between you and me 
              Bm       F                       (C       F C F C F) 
I could honestly say that things can only get better 
        C         G    B7                 Em 
And while I'm away bust out the demons inside 
G7                  C               G 
     And it won't be long before you and me run 
                    Am     F         G    C/G G   Am7  G7 
To the place in our hearts where we hide 
     C                      G/B        F 
And I guess that's why they call it the blues 
           C                  G            F 
Time on my hands could be time spent with you 
C               G 
Laughing like children 
              Am 
Living like lovers 
C/E        F                      D/F# 
Rolling like thunder, under the covers 
      F                 G                C    Em  F 
And I guess that's why they call it the blues 
G 
Just stare into space 
Em       F               (C          F C F C F) 
Picture my face in your hands 
C               G 
Live for each second 
          Bm      F                     (C      F C F C F) 
Without hesitation, never forget I'm your man 
C        G    B7                       Em    G7 
Wait on me girl, cry in the night if it helps 
            C       G 
But more than ever I simply love you 
             Am F      G  C/G G C/G G  Am7  G7 
More than I love life itself 
     C                              G/B        F 
And I guess that's why they call it the blues 
             C                 G             F 
Time on my hands could be time spent with you 
C                 G 
Laughing like children 
               Am 
Living like lovers 
C/E         F                    D/F# 
Rolling like thunder, under the covers 
      F                G                  C 
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
