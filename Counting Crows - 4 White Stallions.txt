Intro: (play Riff 1 over each G chord)
G   | G   | G   | G   | C   | C   | G   | G   |


Verse 1:
        G
She had four white stallions coming around the bend
Em
Four strong angels at her command ascend
C                                           G (riff once)
Four more seasons for all that's broken to mend
      D                      Am                       G (riff twice)
I got four good reasons why I   can't go back there again


Verse 2:
        G
She has skin like a statue - milky white and pure 
Em
Carved by an artist who's hand is demure
      C                                    G (riff once)
Got a mind like a sabre - razor sharp and sure
    D                        Am                 G (riff once)
And god how I hate myself for   still wanting her


Solo: (slide guitar in the key of G)
Cadd9  G
Cadd9  G

Bridge:
Em                                              C7
  Damn these nights of dreaming vision soft and sure    
Em                                                   C
Now I'll wait to find there's nothing left of me and her
        Am                          G (riff four times)
Nothing more than a heart still at war

Outro: (pick the chords)
        G
She had four white stallions coming up around the bend
Em
Four strong angels already sent
Am               C                          G (riff once)
Four more seasons for all that's broken to mend
      D                      Am                     G
I got four good reasons why I  can't go back there again  yeah
I got four good reasons why I  can't go back there again
      D                     C                      G
I got four more seasons for all that's broken to mend
