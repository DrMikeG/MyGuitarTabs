                      Ironic - Alanis Morissette

Notes:  If there are spacing errors...  That's because I didn't type all this up
on a PC or Mac!  Requires a minimum of 2 guitars.  Guitar 1 plays the intro 
rhythm where required and the sections where the chords are shown above the 
lyrics. Guitar 2 handles all the rhythm figures and adds the boost in the song 
by accompanying Guitar 1 with some of the chords in the chorus sections.  
Ideally, Guitar 1 should be acoustic and Guitar 2 should have a switch between a 
soft neck postion sound and distortion. The chords in verse 1 are to be played 
really softly and smoothly, almost sweep picking the strings. In verse 3, 
Guitar 1 plays the chords shown, but this time adding a lot of palm muting 
between chord changes (listen to the track). Later on in verse 3, on the part 
where "And isn't it ironic...  etc..." is sung, Guitar 1 arpeggiates the chords 
instead of just strumming the chords (again, listen to the track).

         Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you

                                 (Rhy Fig 6)
         And life has a funny way of helping you out when you think

Verse 3:  (Play Rhy Fig 7 throughout)

            F#      B                F#      G#m
          A traffic jam when you are already late

               F#      B            F#        G#m
          A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break

                    F#           B                   F#        G#m
          It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife

          (No instruments on these last two lines)

          It's like meeting the man of my dreams

          And then meeting his beautiful wife

                    F#    B                  F#        G#m
