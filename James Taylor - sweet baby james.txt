Verse 1:
D                   A     G5                  F#m
There is a young cowboy;  he lives on the range.
    Bm            G5                 D        F#m
His Horse and his cattle are his only companions.
   Bm           G5         D                 F#m
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons,
G5          D           A           Em7       A Asus2 A
waiting for summer, his pastures to change.
    G5                    A7sus4        D
And as the moon rises, he sits by his fire
Bm             G5        D          A
thinking about women and glasses of beer.  
    G5                         A7sus4          D
And closing his eyes while the doggies retire.
      Bm          G5         D
He sings out a song which is soft but its clear,
  Bm7sus4    E7            A7sus4(type2)
as if maybe someone could hear.


Chorus:
D                         G            A       D
Goodnight all you moonlight ladies
Bm              G                        D
Rock-a-bye sweet baby James
Bm                           G               D
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
               E7s4           E7            A7s4           A
Wont you let me go down in my dreams
       G                A               D
and rock-a-bye sweet baby James.




     D                                A           G              F#m
2. Now the first of December was covered in snow
Bm                G               D                    F#m
so was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
                 Bm                        G
D                F#m
though the Berkshires seemed dreamlike on account of the frosting
        G                D               A
Em7                     A
with ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go.___You know
               G                                          A7s4        D
There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
   Bm                G                     D               A
a song that they sing when they take to the sea
    G                                     A7s4                      D
a song that they sing of their home in the sky
            Bm                G      D
Maybe you can believe if it helps you to sleep
       E7s4                 E7            A7s4                    A
The singing works just fine for me.
