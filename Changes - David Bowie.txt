Verse 1
   C                           Em
Still don't know what I was waiting for
       F                G
And my time was running wild
          F
A million dead-end streets and
C                        Em
Every time I thought I'd got it made
              F                G
It seemed the taste was not so sweet


Pre chorus 1

     Cmaj7    Dm7     Em7    Ebm7
So I turned myself to face me
    Dm7                      G
But I've never caught a glimpse
           Cmaj7       Dm7       Em7  Ebm7
Of how the others must see the faker
             Dm7
I'm much too fast to take that test

Don't want to be a richer man
G        F

Turn and face the strain

Just gonna have to be a different man

Am   G   Bb/C   F
Time may change me
Am         G     Dm      C   (Dm  Em)
But I     can't trace time

Verse 2
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same

Pre-chorus 2
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

Turn and face the strain
      C

F    Am                 D
Where's your shame You've left us up to our necks in it

Interlude
Am   G   Bb/C   F
Time may change me
Am         G     Dm      C   (Dm  Em)
But I     can't trace time

bridge
F                       C          (F/C  C)
Strange fascination, fascinating me

Ah changes are taking the pace I'm going through
