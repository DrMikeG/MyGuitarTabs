              D                 A                   G

   People so busy make me feel dizzy, taxi lights shine so bright

          Em    B            Em7    A

   But i don't     need no friends

                 D                A               G       G B E

   As long as i gaze on Waterloo Sunset, i am in paradise

                 E7                       A       G B E

   Every day i look at the world from my window

                         E7             A7

   The chilly-chilliest evening time,  Waterloo sunset's fine.



2. Terry meets Julie, Waterloo Station, every Friday night

   But i am so lazy, don't want to wander, i stay at home at night

   But i don't feel afraid

   As long as i gaze on Waterloo Sunset, i am in paradise

   Every day i look at the world from my window   

   The chilly chilliest evening time,  Waterloo sunset's fine.


3. Millions of people swarming like flies round Waterloo underground

   Terry and Julie cross over the river where they feel safe and sound

   And they don't need no friends

   As long as they gaze on Waterloo Sunset, they are in paradise

   Every day i look at the world from my window   

   The chilly chilliest evening time,  Waterloo sunset's fine.

   LYRICS:
   
   Dirty old river, must you keep rolling, rolling into the night *
   People so busy, make me feel dizzy, taxi light shines so bright *
   But I don't need no friends
   As long as I gaze on Waterloo Sunset, I am in paradise *
   Every day I look at the world from my window
   Chilly chilliest evening time, Waterloo sunset's fine
   
   
   Terry meets Julie, Waterloo Station, every Friday night *
   But I am so lazy, don't want to wander, I stay at home at night *
   But I don't feel afraid
   As long as I gaze on Waterloo Sunset, I am in paradise *
   Every day I look at the world from my window
   Chilly chilliest evening time,  Waterloo sunset's fine.
   
   Millions of people swarming like flies `round Waterloo underground *
   Terry and Julie cross over the river where they be safe and sound *
   And they don't need no friends
   As long as they gaze on Waterloo Sunset, they are in paradise *

Version 3

Btw this isn’t my work – I’ve just compiled and edited two of the best tabs I could find into one single tab (is that allowed!?) to make it easier for everyone – if so, thanks to : MENDE JOVESKI and Franz Lemmermeyer, who without them i could never have made this in the first place, cos i'm rubbish :-(

Title:   Waterloo Sunset
Artist:  The Kinks
Album:   Something Else by the Kinks (I think), anyway the song was released in mid 1967.

main riff during intro:
(for bending the strings, don't go to far - just enough to slightly change the pitch - it's not a Jimi Hendrix solo!)
