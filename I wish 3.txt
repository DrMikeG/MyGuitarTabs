I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free by Nina Simone

CAPO 1

INTRO:
A,F#m,D,A 
A,F#m,B,E 
A,F#m,D,A
A,F#m,E,A

  A           F#m          D          A
I wish I knew how it would feel to be free
  A            F#m            B             E
I wish I could break all the chains holding me
  A            F#m         D                            A
I wish I could say all the things that I should like to say
 A                    F#m       
Say 'em loud, say 'em clear
         E                   A
For the whole round world to hear

I wish I could share all the love that's in my heart
Remove all the parts that keep us apart
I wish you could know what it means to be me
Then you'd see and agree that every man should be free

I wish I could give all I'm longin' to give
I wish I could live like I'm longin' to live
I wish I could do all the things that I can do
Though I'm way over due
I'd be startin' anew


I wish I could be like a bird in the sky
How sweet it would be if I found I could fly
I'd soar to the song and look down at the scene
A                    F#m 
Then I'd sing 'cos I know, yeah 
A                    F#m 
Then I'd sing 'cos I know, yeah
A                    F#m 
Then I'd sing 'cos I know, I'd know how it feels

ENJOY: A-F#m is played until finish.
