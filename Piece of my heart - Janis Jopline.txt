    The Last part is a little tricky.
    You need to mess around with this chords.
    I can't tab the the picking pattern,
    so just pick the strings randomly while
    keeping time with the record.


VERSE:


       E           A         B         A

e |------0-----------5--------7---------5------------
B |------0-----------5--------7---------5------------ Repeat this a few
G |--1p0h1-------6p5h6--------8---------6------------ times with small
D |---------------------------9---------7------------ adjustments.
A |(2)---------(7)---------(9)-------(7)-------------
E |-0-----------5-----------7---------5--------------


       E           A         B         B

e |---0--------------5--------7------7--7----7-------
B |---0--------------5--------7------7--7----7-------

D |---------------------------9------9--9----9-------
A |(2)---------(7)---------(9)-------9--9----9-------
E |-0-----------5-----------7--------7--7----7-------

  Then strum these chords:

  | C#m |  B  |  D  |  B  |
  |  B  |  B  |  B  |  B  |

CHORUS:

  |  E  |  A  |  B  |  A  |        x 2
  |  E  |  A  |  B  | B Bb |
  |  A  |  A  | A Abm F#m |  E  |
                 ^  ^  ^
               Fast (triplet)
