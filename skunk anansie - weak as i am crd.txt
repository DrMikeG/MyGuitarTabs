SKUNK ANANSIE : Weak as I am

E          D                 C            C
Lost in time I can^Òt count the words
E          D                 C            C
I said when I thought they went unheard
E          D                 C            C
All of those hash thoughts so unkind
E          D                 C            C
Cos I wanted you

And now I sit here all alone
So here sits a fucking mess, tears fly home
A circle of angles, deep in war
Cos I wanted you

Weak as I am, No tears for you
Weak as I am, No tears for you
Deep as I am, I^Òm no ones fool
Weak as I am

So what am I now I^Òm loves last home
I^Òm all of the soft words I once owned
If I opened my heart, there^Òd be no space for air
Cos I wanted you

Weak as I am, No tears for you
Weak as I am, No tears for you
Deep as I am, I^Òm no ones fool
Weak as I am

G  A
In this tainted soul
C
In this weak young heart
D
Am I too much for you

In this tainted soul
In this weak young heart
Am I too much for you

In this tainted soul
In this weak young heart
Am I too much for you

E                  C            D
Weak as I am
Weak as I am
Weak as I am
Weak as I am
am
am
Weak as I am
Am I too much for you
Weak as I am
Am I too much for you
Weak as I am
Am I too much for you
Weak as I am
