Alone tonight in someone else's bed She went and dyed her hair red

    D             A   G             A          D            A   G   A  
She only went and did what she did 'Cause he would drive her home then

   D               A          G       A      D         A      G     A
There's lipstick on her brand new dress She hadn't even paid yet

But it doesn't matter where the money went It wasn't how she paid 'er rent

There's got to be someone we can trust out here among us



Now lookin' out across the city lights
She thought they'd be a good pair
Now he could make a living sellin' cars
Maybe she could work there
She's gonna pick a star in the night
And pray to make it all right
She tried so hard not to pick a kite
She always prayed to head lights

One, two, three Marlenas
There's got to be someone we can trust
Out here among us
One, two, three Marlenas
It's see no, speak no, hear no evil about us
The three Marlenas

Man, I think I'm gonna buy myself a Rolls
Maybe a Chevrolet
One where I can pull that top down
Just let my radio play
Now I'm headin' out on that highway
I'm goin' right out of state
Now I ain't lookin' back until I'm gone
Right through heaven's gates

One, two, three Marlenas
There's got to be someone we can trust
Out here among us
One, two, three Marlenas
Ya see no, speak no, hear no evil among us
The three Marlenas
