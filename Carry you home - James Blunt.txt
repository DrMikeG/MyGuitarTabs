[intro]
G5  Em C (2x)

[vers1]
  G5            Em          C                   G5     Em     C
Trouble is her only friend and he's back again
  G5            Em          C          G5     Em     C
Makes her body older than it really is
  G5                          Em
And she says it's high time she went away
     C                       G5     Em     C
No ones got much to say in this time
  G5            Em          C     G5     D
Trouble is the only way is down,   down, down

[chorus]
  G5 
As strong as you were
             Em
Tender you got
                    D
I'm watching you breathing
               C
For the last time
                  G5 
A song for your heart
             Em
But when it is quiet
                    D
I know what it means
               C
And I'll carry you home
                  G5 
I'll carry you home

G5     Em     C 2x

[vers2]
  G5                             Em
If she had wings she would fly away
         C                            G5     Em     C
And another day god will give her some
  G5            Em          C     G5     D
Trouble is the only way is down,    down,down

[chorus]
 G5 
As strong as you were
              Em
Tender you got
                            D             C*
I'm watching you breathing for the last time
                 G5 
A song for your heart
               Em
But when it is quiet
                 D
I know what it means
               C*
I'll carry you home
                G5 
I'll carry you home

[bridge]
  C                    G5 
And they all want pretty
                   D
New York City lights
  C                    G5                            D
And summers little girl has been taken from the world tonight
  C          G5           D
But the stars and stripes

[chorus 2x]
  G5 
As strong as you were
            Em
Tender you got
                          D               C
I'm watching you breathing for the last time
                   G5 
A song for your heart
               Em
But when it is quiet
                D
I know what it means
                     C
And i'll carry you home

               G5        Em       C
I'll carry you home
