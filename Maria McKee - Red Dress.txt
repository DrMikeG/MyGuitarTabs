VERSE 1:

A  D        A     D A
My heart is empty
E             A    D
Your eyes are dull
A    D       A      D A
Once we were hungry
G   D          A     A7
Now we are full


CHORUS:

D               A        D A
These ties that bind us
B7                 D  Dsus4 D Dsus2
Can't beat these chaaaaaains
A  D       A       D A
If love is shelter
G           D           A    
I'm gonna walk in the rain
D   A   D   A   G   A  Asus2


VERSE 2
You were my angel
Now you are real
So like a stranger
Colder than steel


CHORUS:

The morning after
No one should braaaaaaaaaaaaag
If love is a red dress
Well hang me in rags


BRIDGE:
-------
D          A
Ooooooooh  well
E              Esus4 A    A7
There goes the fairy tale
D     Dsus4      A
Lord, ain't it a shame
D           A
In all this comfort
G              A
I can't take the strain
D   A   D   A   G   A  Asus2


VERSE 3:
--------
If we played even
E     Esus4  A     D Dsus4 D
I'd be your queen
A   D           A        D A
But someone was cheatin'
G     D         A   A7
and it wasn't me


CHORUS:
-------
I played on the table
You held something baaaaaaaack
If love is aces
Give me the jack
