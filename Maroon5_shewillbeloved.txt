Bm                    A
Beauty queen of only eighteen
Bm                            A
She had some trouble with herself
Bm                  A
He was always there to help her
Bm                               A
She always belonged to someone else

Bm           A
I drove for miles and miles
       Bm                     A
And wound up at your door
Bm             A
I've had you so many times but 
Bm                    A
somehow I want more

D5                            A
I don't mind spending everyday
Bm                                G5
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
D5                                A
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Bm                              G5
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
             D5        A
And she will be loved
Bm            G
She will be loved
(Repeat same rythm)

Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You can come anytime you want

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved

I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls
    --There it is, simple and accurate--
