Intro (clever non f)

C        G       Am         F
I remember 	when we used to sit
In the government yard in trenchtown,

Observing all the hypocrites
As they mingle with the good people.

Good friends we have, good friends we’ve lost
Along 		the way.

In this great future	you can’t forget your past
So dry your tears,	I say.


(clever non f)
No, woman, no cry;
No, woman, no cry.
Hey little darlin’, don’t shed no tears:
No, woman, no cry.



I remember, when we used to rock
On a project yard in Jersey.
And little Georgie, would make the fire live,
As stolen cars pass through the night.

And then we'd hit the corner store,
For Roots paper and ro, oooo (?)
My dreams, my only remedy
For pain of losing family
Oh while I'm gone shorty.


Everything’s gonna be all right!
Everything’s gonna be all right!
Everything’s gonna be all right!
Everything’s gonna be all right!
I said, everything’s gonna be all right-a!
Everything’s gonna be all right!
Everything’s gonna be all right, now!
Everything’s gonna be all right!

So, woman, no cry;
No - no, woman - woman, no cry.
Woman, little sister, don’t shed no tears;
No, woman, no cry.

I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in trenchtown.
And then georgie would make the fire lights,
As it was logwood burnin’ through the nights.
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge,
Of which I’ll share with you;
My feet is my only carriage,
So I’ve got to push on through.
But while I’m gone:

No, woman, no cry;
No, woman, no cry.
Woman, little darlin’, say don’t shed no tears;
No, woman, no cry.
