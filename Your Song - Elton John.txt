G                 Cmaj7   D/F#        Bm
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside

Em             Em/D             Em/C    C
I'm not one of those who can, easily hide

G/D              D        B7/D#         Em
I don't have much money, but , boy if I did

G               Am7            C          D
I'd buy a big house where,  we both could live

If I was a sculpter,  but then again no
or a man who make potions for a travelling show
well I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and  this one's for you

{ play G instead of D at end of verses 2 and 4 }

CH:

D/F#              Em         Am             C
And you can tell everybody   this is your song
D/F#      Em                  Am            C
It may be quite simple but ,  now that it's done
Em                     Em/D
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
Em/C                  C
that I put down in words
G/B           C         C                 D
How wonderful life is, when you're in the world

I sat on the roof    and kicked off the moss
well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind,  well I wrote down this song
It's for people like you that,  keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting,  but these things I do
you see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway,  the thing is ,  what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen



repeat chorus, repeating last two lines ( from I hope) twice.
And changing last D to G
