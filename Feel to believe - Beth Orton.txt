Feel To believe

Capo 2

E       (022100)

E            Emaj7
 You lose it      just to find it

Asus2       A7
 And as you walk right by it

E         Emaj7
 You foret     How you got there

A            A7
 And why you never meant to stay

(same chords)
And I watch you waste away
And I won't fake another day
And if one truth leads you to five
I still don't belive in your reasons why
Just don't believe in why



You love her, you need her
To feel is to belive her
You know it, you want it
You just can't believe you've got it
And I can't watch you waste away
And I won't beg you still to stay
And if one truth leads you to five
I still don't belive in your reasons why
Just don't belive in why

A                          B/A
 I couldn't watch you walk away and not forget it

A                             B/A                            A
 I couldn't watch you turn to stone and just regret a single day

             B/A               A                 B/A
Not a single day, not a single day, not a single day


If i lose you, could you find me?
Or would you walk right by me
The sould and the spirit
Each have got their own limit
And I can't waste another second
Living in hell like it's some kind of heaven
And if one truth leads to another
Isn't there one I can't uncover?
There isn't one that I will not discover
It's the right time,
It's my time
It's the right time,
It's my time, it's my turn to discover


E    Emaj7   A   A7


And I won't waste a single second
Living in hell as a nadir of heaven
And if one truth leads you to five
I still don't believe in your reasons why


E    Emaj7   A   A7


And if one truth leads to another
Isn't there one we can't uncover?
If there isn't one that we cannot discover
It's the right time, it's our time to discover.

	Verse 1

	You lose it just to find it
	And as you walk right by it
	You forget how you got there
	And why you never meant to stay
	And I won't watch you waste away
	And I won't fake another day
	And if one truth leads you to five
	I still don't believe in your reasons why

	I just don't believe in why

	Verse 2

	You love her You need her
	To feel is to believe her
	You know it  You want it
	You just can't believe you've got it
	And I can't watch you waste away
	And I won't beg you still to stay
	And if one truth leads you to five
	I still don't believe in your reasons why

	I just don't believe in why
	I just don't believe in why

	Bridge

	I couldn't watch you walk away 
	And not forget it

	I couldn't watch you turn to stone 
	And just regret it a single day

	Not a single day

	Verse 3

	If I lose you Could you find me?
	Or would you walk right by me?
	The soul and the spirit
	Each have got their own limit
	And I can't waste another second
	Living in hell like it's some kind of heaven
	And if one truth leads to another
	Isn't there one I can uncover?

	There isn't one I will not discover
