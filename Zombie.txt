1st VERSE:

Em        CMAj   
"Another head hangs lowly
 GMaj             F#m
 Child is slowly taken
Em           CMAj
 And the violence caused such silence
 GMaj           F#m
 Who are we mistaken
Em               
 but you see, it's not me
         CMAj
 it's not my family
          GMaj
 in your head, in your head
               F#m
 they are fighting
             Em
 With their tanks, and their bombs, 
            CMAj
 and their bombs, and their guns
         GMaj                        F#m
 In your head, in your head they are cryin'

CHORUS:

         Em            CMAj
"In your head, In your head
    GMaj     F#m
 Zombie, etc.
                Em                         CMAj
 What's in your head in your head, in your head
    GMaj      F#m
 Zombie, etc."

"Zombie"

Another head hangs lowly, 
Child is slowly taken. 
And the violence caused such silence, 
Who are we mistaken? 

But you see, it's not me, it's not my family. 
In your head, in your head they are fighting, 
With their tanks and their bombs, 
And their bombs and their guns. 
In your head, in your head, they are crying... 

In your head, in your head, 
Zombie, zombie, zombie, 
Hey, hey, hey. What's in your head, 
In your head, 
Zombie, zombie, zombie? 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, dou, dou, dou, dou, dou... 

Another mother's breakin', 
Heart is taking over. 
When the vi'lence causes silence, 
We must be mistaken. 

It's the same old theme since nineteen-sixteen. 
In your head, in your head they're still fighting, 
With their tanks and their bombs, 
And their bombs and their guns. 
In your head, in your head, they are dying... 

In your head, in your head, 
Zombie, zombie, zombie, 
Hey, hey, hey. What's in your head, 
In your head, 
Zombie, zombie, zombie? 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh, oh, 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey, oh, ya, ya-a...
