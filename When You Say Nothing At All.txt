Ronan Keating - When You Say Nothing At All


Intro (G,D,G,C)

Verse 1 (G,D,G,C)
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word you can light up the dark


Bridge 
(C,D)
Try as I may I can never explain
(G,D,C,D)
What I hear when you don't say a thing


Chorus 
(G,D,C,D)
 The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
(G,D,C,D)
 Cause the truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
(G,D,C,D)
 The touch of your hand said you'll catch me where ever I fall
(G,D)
 You say it best when you say nothing at all


Solo:
(G,D,C,D)

Verse 2:
(G,D,C,D)
 All day long I can hear people talking aloud
(G,D,C,D)
 But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd


Bridge:
(C,D)
 Try as they may they can never define
(G,D,C,D)
 What's been said between your heart and mine

Chorus:
(G,D,C,D)
 The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
(G,D,C,D)
 Cause the truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
(G,D,C,D)
 The touch of your hand said you'll catch me where ever I fall
(G,D)
 You say it best when you say nothing at all
