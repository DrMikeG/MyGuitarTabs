[VERSE 1]

C			                 G
You only stay with me in the morning
F			            G7
You only hold me when I sleep
Am			                 C C9 C
I was meant to tread the water
F		      G7
Now Ive gotten in too deep
Am			   C
For every piece of me that wants you
F        D/F#          Gadd9
Another piece backs away

Just to spend a little time alone with me
Am			               C
Like I said, ive never bought you flowers
F		            G7
I cant work out what they need

F        D/F#              Gadd9
that was someones else's dream...
