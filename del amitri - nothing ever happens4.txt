And bachelors phone up their friends for a drink
                     A                   G
While the married ones turn on a chat show

D					          Bm
Gentlemen time please you know we can't serve any more
D					Bm
Now the traffic lights stop when theres nothing to go
G		                  D
And by five o clock everythings dead
A		         Bm	
And every third car is a cab
G			          D
And ignorant people sleep in there beds
	   A		                  Bm
Like the dope white mice in the college lab

 D             G          D                  G
Nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all
         Bm                             G
The needle returns to the start of the song
            A                  G
And we all sing along like before
           D               G                    D
And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow

Telephone exchanges click while theres nobody there
D					            Bm
The martians could land in the car park and no-one would care
G				D
Close-circuit cameras in department stores
A			      Bm
Shoot the same movie every night
G                                                    D
And the stars of these films neither died nor get killed
             A			   Bm	
Just to survive constant action replay

And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow

While angry from Manchester writes to complain about all the repeats on tv
G		              D
And computer terminals report some gains
A		     	   Bm
On the value of copper and tin
G			        D
While American businessmen snap up van Goths
            A			Bm
For the price of a hospital wing
