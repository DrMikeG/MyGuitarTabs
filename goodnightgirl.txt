VERSE ONE

   | A        | A         | Dmaj7   | Dmaj7
You hear me so clearly and see how I try;

   | A        | A         | Dmaj7   | Dmaj7
you feel me so heal me and tear me apart.

   | Gmaj7          | Gmaj7      | A         | A
And I won't tell a soul, I won't tell at all

   | Gmaj7            | Gmaj7    | Bm7
and do they have to know

 | Bm7 (with Bass E)
about my goodnight girl.


CHORUS

| A                            | A
Caught up in your wishing well, your hopes inside it,

| F#m7                   | F#m7               | Bm7
take your love and promises and make them last,

   | Bm7 (with Bass E)
you make them last.


VERSE TWO

You keep me so near you and see me so far;

   | A         | A     | Dmaj7      | Dmaj7
and hold me and send me deep in your heart.

   | Gmaj7             | Gmaj7  | A          | A
And I won't tell a soul, I won't tell at all

   | Gmaj7               | Gmaj7    | Bm7
and I won't let them know

 | Bm7 (with Bass E)
about my goodnight girl.

take your love and promises and make them last,

   | Bm7 (with Bass E)
You make them last.

| A                            | A
Caught up in your wishing well, your hopes inside it,

| F#m7                   | F#m7               | Bm7
take your love and promises and make them last,

you make them last.


BRIDGE

| Dmaj9                 | Amaj7
    Doesn't matter how sad I made you,

| Dmaj9                 | Amaj7
    doesn't matter how hard I've tried.

| Dmaj9                | Amaj7
    Just remember the same old reason

  | Cmaj7
reflected in your eyes you said you wanted me.
