[ VERSE 1 ]
            A
25 years of my life and still
            Bm
Tryin' to to get up that great big hill of
            D                    A2
Hope, for a destination.
            A
I realized quickly when I knew I should
            Bm
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of
            D                    A2
Man, for whatever that means.

[ CHORUS ]

And so I cry sometimes, when I'm lying in bed

just to get all out, what's in my head, then 

I, I am feeling, a little peculiar.

And so I wake in the morning, and I step outside 

And I take a deep breath, and I get real high, and 

I, scream from the top of my lungs, "What's going on?" 


And I say, "Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah."  

I said, "Hey, what's going on?"

And I say, "Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah."

I said, "Hey, what's going on?"

And I try, oh my god, do I try
   Bm          D                          A2
I try all the time, in this institution. 
           A
And I pray, oh my god, do I pray
   Bm                D                      A2
I pray every single day, for a revolution.

Hope, for a destination...
