Strumming: D_DUDU

C//     C//        F//       C//
Amazing grace, How sweet the sound
     Am//    Am//     G//  G//
That saved a wretch like me.
   C//     C//       F//      C//
I once was lost, but now I am found,
    Am//       G//     C//   C//
Was blind, but now I see.


C//     C//        F//       C//
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
     Am//    Am//     G//  G//
And grace my fears relieved.
C//     C//       F//      C//
How precious did that grace appear
Am//       G//     C//   C//
The hour I first believed.

C//     C//        F//       C//
Through many dangers, toils and snares
 Am//    Am//     G//  G//
I have already come,
C//     C//        F//       C//
'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far
    Am//       G//     C//   C//
And grace will lead me home.


C//     C//        F//       C//
When we've been there ten thousand years
Am//    Am//     G//  G//
Bright shining as the sun,
C//     C//       F//      C//
We've no less days to sing God's praise
    Am//       G//     C//   C//
Than when we've first begun.
