Pickin on me
Skunk Anansie - Stoosh
Okay here's my go at Pickin' on me. On the bit marked with the * hold the shape 
x3xx13  and slide it up two frets to x5xx35 so it sounds right. It might be a
bit of a stretch but it sounds better than not fretting B at all.

Lyrics:

(I think these are right, but dont quote me on that one)

Verse 1

I saw a weird boy
He looked at me with a look of pure hate
Nobody knew all the grief where he'd been
He was a sad boy
He was the victim of a dirty good time
Feely games in the back of his boarded up estate

Chorus

Soon enough he's pickin on me
Kicked my head in cos its all that he'd see
Soon enough he's pickin on me
Pickin on me

Verse 2

I told my teacher
She looked at me so indifferently
Her whole night was spent marking paper red tape (?)
So I had to learn to fight
Kicked his sister cos I had no respect
So here's the start of another war, you against me
